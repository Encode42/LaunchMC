# flags.sh
### A simple script generator to start your Minecraft servers with optimal flags.

</div>

Includes many configuration options such as Aikar's flags, automatic restarting, and Pterodactyl container overhead calculation.

Inspired by [startmc.sh](https://startmc.sh), and built with [qwik](https://qwik.builder.io).

This is the `qwik` branch, which is a rewrite from scratch using modern technologies and better design philosophies. As such, it is missing many essential features from the current production version.

### üî®  Building
Ensure [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) are installed.

1. Enter the directory containing the flags.sh source code in your terminal.
2. Install the build dependencies via `pnpm install`.
3. Start a live development environment and make your changes.
  - `pnpm run dev`: Start a live development environment
4. Ensure your changes work in a production environment.
  - `pnpm run build`: Build for production
  - `pnpm run deploy`: Deploy an example Cloudflare Pages environment
